## Overview

This repository contains the robot code for our test robot, **Larry**. The code is based on the documentation from the [FIRST Robotics Competition WPI Lib](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html).

We are actively working on integrating **Larry** with a Raspberry Pi as a coprocessor. The Raspberry Pi, equipped with a camera and running OpenCV, will assist in vision processing. This is also guided by the [WPI Lib documentation for vision processing](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/vision-processing/wpilibpi/index.html).

Note: The code for the Raspberry Pi coprocessor is maintained in a [separate repository](https://github.com/rrmcmurry/WestPi/).

## How to Use

To use this code:
1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/rrmcmurry/9668_Larry.git`
2. Follow the instructions in the WPI Lib documentation to set up the environment.
3. Open Visual Studio Code (WPI implementation), then go to **File > Open Folder**, and select the folder where this repository was cloned.


## Repository Structure

- `/src/main/java/frc/robot/`: Contains all robot code written in Java for FRC development.

## Getting Involved

This repository is maintained by **Robby McMurry**, a robotics mentor who is diving into the world of robotics with a passion to learn.

Feel free to contribute or raise issues as we continuously improve **Larry's** performance!
